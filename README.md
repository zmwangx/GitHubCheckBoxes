## What it does

This extension basically does `perl -pe 's/^(\s*)-\s+[ ]/\1- [x]/g'` on all
textareas of a GitHub page, including hidden ones.

## How to use

Just click the check button.

## Caution

1. All `textarea` tags are affected by this extension. At the time of writing,
   there is one `textarea` associated to each comment that belongs to the
   currently logged-in user, even if it is not being edited; and the
   modifications will show up if you later click the edit button. Be aware of
   unwanted edits.

2. A line like

   ```markdown
       - [ ] Lorem ipsum
   ```

   will be checked by this extension, although it could either be part of a
   code block (which probably shouldn't be touched) or a checklist item in an
   indented region (e.g. within a list item). It's impossible to tell the
   difference without parsing entire textareas as Markdown, so just beaware.

## Packaging

[`extensionator`](https://github.com/Zensight/extensionator) may be used for
packing the extension. You'll need a PEM key for packing. You may generate the
key with `openssl` if you don't yet have one:

```bash
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -out key.pem
```

Then,

```bash
gem install extensionator
extensionator --directory="source" --identity="key.pem" --output="dist/GitHubCheckBoxes-$(git describe 2>/dev/null).crx"
```
